Plugins
=======

Plugins are a great way to easily extend the existing functionality of the SpiderScope software. plugins are used to do things like plotting graphs, displaying information, keeping track of statistics, perform automated actions, and so much more. Plugins are written and python, and are simple to write. Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/pcDataSpider/plugins/wiki) for more information on installing and building you own plugins!

Installation
=======
1. Clone this repository
2. If it does not exist, create a new directory named "Plugins" inside your SpiderScope installation.
3. In your "Plugins" folder from step 2, create a new directory (such as "Tools") and move all .py files inside.
4. Launch SpiderScope. The plugins should be available in the toolbar.

SpiderScope-Gen2
=========
If you are using SpiderScope-Gen2:
Create a "Plugins" directory in the SAME DIRECTORY as the "SpiderScope" directory.
Move all .py files directly in the "Plugins" directory.
